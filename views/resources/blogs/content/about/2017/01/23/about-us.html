    <p>Videbligo is a real-time, cloud-based analytics tool. Simply stated, we provide un-biased visuals to help companies make better decisions.</p>

<p>Using our own software, we make sense of  the data within an organization. What makes us so special is our ability to do this quickly, saving companies time and money against competitors.</p>

<p>The reason our solution works so well is that we have spent 4 years listening to the customer, finding the pain points and filling the gaps. We don’t claim to be the best solution in all areas - rather, we focus on doing a few things really well. The areas we focus on are based on feedback from clients and prospects. When they presented challenges, Videbligo presented solutions.</p>

<p>After several years of providing a workable solution, a platform evolved. This platform offered scalability, security, cloud and rapid deployment in one package, enabling customers to see value from day one. That became our promise - to provide value.</p>

<p>The industry is full of organizations that promise that ‘Big Data’ will solve any and all business challenges. Yet, time and again industry research has shown that the value has yet to be obtained. Videbligo fullfills this promise.</p>

<p>During our incubation period, Videbligo has solicited the input of 32 different buyers of big data solutions. Based on our research and normalization of our 32 unique buyers, we estimate that the average initial investment for a Big Data solution is $2.2M with a project implementation time of 60-180 days.</p>

<p>Our findings also validated what we already knew to be true, that the Total Cost of Ownership of Big Data was less in the initial outlay and much more in the ongoing investment in data scientists. Our findings indicated that Plan &amp; Build accounted for only 19% of TCO, with the remaining being allocated to Run and Data Scientists.</p>

<p>Further, our research showed that the promises of big data for to benefit business was expected 84% of the time, but only 16% actually recognized business benefits.</p>

<h1 id="whats-in-a-name">What’s In a Name?</h1>

<p>Videbligo translates to the word “Visualization” in the language of Esperanto. Esperanto itself is an auxilary language that was developed in the late 1800’s to trancend political and cultural bias. At Videbligo, we believe that excellence in Visualization involves the same trancending of bias by letting large amounts of data tell their own story without any distortions to the data. We believe that excellence in visualization involves three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Communication of complex ideas with clarity, precision and efficiency</li>
  <li>Induce the viewer to think about the substance, not the methodology.</li>
  <li>Avoid distorting what the data has to say.</li>
</ol>

<p>More to come soon!</p>
