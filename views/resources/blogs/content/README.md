# vdb-blogs
This is the repository for all blogs published on www.videbligo.com

This repository will be a public repo containing all of our blog posts. It relies on the private repo vdb-www which has the build instructions.

Build instructions include moving all the files from posts to the angular js views directory in a structure that is compatible with the slug controller that can find the files based on ui-srefs.
